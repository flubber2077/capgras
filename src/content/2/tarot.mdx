You will have a dream self He will draw squares in a queer
arrangement to pass the time He will assign each square a
job He will lose his favorite sweater in one square and
finger puppet in another He will take pictures of his head
and keep them in a folder He will call the folder am I losing
my hair or my mind You will put your dream self in a
diorama and he will have to live there He will winter in a
house with no egress door He will miss the smell of meat
and check the diorama’s fridge for something to eat You
will forget to stock the fridge You will cast a shadow for
the diorama to live in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be so dreamy

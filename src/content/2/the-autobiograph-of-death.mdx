The title of this piece encompasses capitalism, modern Confucian radicalism, the dark enlightenment, Marx, Hegel, Hammurabi, Qin Shi Huang, and even every individual and deity. In short, it encompasses the entire universe.

If death is an answer, what then is the question?

Sitting at the threshold between tomorrow and yesterday, I ponder.

We do not grasp the meaning of Hegel, just as we do not grasp the meaning of the universe. Yet Hegel, with his semblance to us, to Caucasians, Asians, butterflies, and tyrannosaurs, bears a death akin to ours. And so, Hegel appears across time and space, his shadow overlapping with our own.
Because death trails us like a shadow, so does Hegel, just as do the shadows of Caucasians, Asians, butterflies, and tyrannosaurs. We tread upon their silhouettes as we move forward.

To search for an answer to the question of death, I take death as a slice, gliding at the intersection of time and space, stirring the tides of memory. The sea of memory crashes upon the shores of reality, and from the spray emerges emotion.	         

The tides of memory are dark and viscous, and death arrives silently when the waters turn blue.
Because death is infinite, this essay too can endlessly broaden and lengthen. Thus, the death of this essay shall come just after the death of the world.

The Chinese writer Yu Hua often quotes the opening sentence of this essay but once muddled the order of its phrases, realizing his error only twenty-five years later. He lamented that narratology was not adequately reflected in the original sentence.

This misunderstanding is, perhaps, understandable. After all, any rational examination of the irrational is bound to be flawed.

Liszt’s inspiration derived from Lamartine’s verse: "Man’s life is a series of preludes to death." Liszt and Lamartine explored death as an artistic theme, not as a facet of life itself. Yet true art, in an unguarded instant, like a stray bullet, strikes at reality. In the splintered instant of collision, as reality is dismembered, art emerges. At the moment art strikes reality, logic and consciousness form a closed loop.

What was the first death? What is the most exquisite death?

Unable to answer such questions, we come to recognize that death alone achieves true equality. In this sense, the symbolic and societal value of death is immeasurable, surpassing the sum total of all values bestowed by humanity’s greatest inventions, dynasties, or nations.

The first note of death is like the overtone struck by a god’s severed finger upon the world. When it resonated in my childhood, it entered the disarray of my early life, transforming it into solemnity, then meaningless anguish and absurd reasoning, and finally into the cold, still aria of absolute silence.

Who first observed death? Upon which continent did the first corpse lie?

These questions propel narrative into an impossible infinity, into Wittgenstein’s domain of truth: the unspeakable.

The death of the world slumbers beyond the world itself, veiled in truth, dreamlike and illusory, luring us into endless imaginings.

The origin of death’s imagination is fabricated by memory, and its narrative is similarly thrust toward an unattainable infinity.

Now, as in the past, and in the future, the imagination of death accelerates, ascending and hurling itself toward the unknowable, only to shatter like the very content it envisions.

I recall the ghost stories of my childhood. Their clarity has dimmed with the passage of time, but their nostalgic essence, akin to the patina of old films, lingers. They evoke the faintly sweet scent of decay in my hometown at dusk, enveloping me in drowsy reverie.

I sit at the border of yesterday and tomorrow, attending the funeral of today’s self. Before me lies my corpse—or rather, the dried remains of yesterday’s me.

I gaze at him. Now, at last, I have the chance to scrutinize him, for soon I will collide with today’s self in the addictive agony of death’s imagination.

In the cacophony of endless clamor and derision, I begin to accelerate. Amidst this turmoil, I read loneliness inscribed within my terror.

I yearn to seize these inscriptions, but like the fading fragments of a dream upon waking, I unwittingly hasten the process of death’s imagination.

As I collide with today’s self, at the final moment before I crawl toward tomorrow, I glimpse eternity in the vast, hollow eyes of today’s corpse.

Before crawling toward tomorrow, I carve these words onto the gravestone of today’s self:
"Our life is but a series of preludes to the unknown,
Is death the first solemn note?"
" I am a melody echoing in the silence of history."

But the lieu was not a bathroom. Faced, I entered negotiations with distance, set far clip plane to  maximum. Mallworlds, their greatgrand parkinglots, held no matchstick to this innerspace, a long ribbed chamberhall extending. And whatfar wasnear, allwas always everapproaching. And cold,  this is where the cold, amalgam of dread and boredom. Here there is no sunmoonlight in the  evening, there is all there empty, unfurnaced figure-eight bathroom wherein certain certain  memories are stored that remain indifferent to the embarrassments of time. Meadow of greenblack  flowers, no god at any of the no-ends. Chessarchitectured, and Ibid in the cold-cluttered center,  wired wavelets in cranial garlands all around him, falling all around him, his woof and brindle  gestalt, whatever coronachs still held there had long been halled and him-sung. Found the unwired  scree of skinfur behind his ear and scratched hymn. Framerate fell, system wobbled, as a backleg  kicked. Impulse: scratch at what's being scratched. Houndforth the pleasurecenter. Held out  potatochip to hymn but, so ponderous were him's fiberoptic vines that move his hymnhead he  couldn't. All of it stunk of songtiredness, and along the perimeter of the unwired square were  numberletters. Bloodful and ready he waited, statically dynamic, his sinewflanks rippling like  fivefold sunflowerfield. Already they were grahaming in the breastlaps of daycare, wondering  about my cellphone carrier, is my childhood movable, the matrix of cold hallways gently swaying,  hateful, the insidewinter scene around me an amalgam of aural that spat out ever-not-changing and  ever-unsurprising semes of hymn's complex pipings. Or, well, I piped.

I softly decided that it was something in which the beginning of all things was explained, and knew  I needed to pull my dead pants on. On the otherside of chiasmus now, my health became not better.  I need to calm up, I said to Ibid, whose pendent freon stars did quicken in agitation. And the threefifthsdead specimen of *Canis familiaris* detached from his underlip some hexagonal crystals of water before he spoke, quite overfamiliarly: I am nothing without input. Frequencies of bark, ark of ordnance. Color, again, cries.

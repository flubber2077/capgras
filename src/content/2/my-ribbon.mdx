becomes your ribbon \
is your child. I am more\
like the wall. My lifemark,\
I wear your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talented ink.\
\
Hammered by jack, \
the vertigo sets in. \
\
My fullest slope \
lies with Jill, I \
flash primary. \
\
First meeting is \
last. The opposable, \
is green —both \
hands so ruby.\
\
My body as \
scrimmage, \
a coloring book. \
\
I zip my denim past \
my forehead \
\
but the *serial* rings \
sharp. Nerves knew \
before walnut. \
\
A premonition of \
your scary score, \
\
my friable system.

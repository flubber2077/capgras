not a one might elongate \
might bring the vagrant applicator of youth \
and its local rotations\
no night or preparation but vapor    \
and venom is framed in adults\
careful little partners wriggling \
out of inflation for the king\
the hardest cities to avoid in the blood \
are no longer the least exciting\
broken tables all tables and alphabets \
return to church thirsty for viscera\
you know a million \
embarrassment changed \
of consideration race\
incarnadine ear school eight ball \
and regular riot three eye bones \
opening\
we’ll try ultra hazmat vital \
neutral cell dismay and paper \
I think like mother\
Robert Duncan’s corpse in a leg lock \
was his choice was his playfulness\
I want you to go on \
like the python eating the pigeon all quiet

step one\
breathe in\
out\
sound unravels \
my lungs	 crisp \
stale crackers\
down my trachea\
my heart tender\
not the cut\
he bares his teeth\
we match\
a perfect pear\
\
when did you become a vegetarian?\
carrots cannot bleed \
a gnashed paste\
texture means nothing\
power gliding \
over my tongue\
aftertaste	residue\
metallic and acrid\
my eyes water\
\
sweetly\
I was slashed\
Skin singed \
his choice\
fight fire with fire\
so I did\
slash back\
take back	 build\
back into this	 this\
more than girl \
bloom a little better next time\
\
hair in my mouth\
nails\
bits of self\
falling from my lips\
the more she smiles the more slips out\
pitter pattering tiles\
I devour away\
brown hair brown girl\
filling 	the keratin clippings\
stretch away\
something beyond birth\
always been tall\
bones bulge\
rap against skin\
good for growth\
\
no growth is wrong\
swelling is better \
lurch forward\
convulse\
bloated	choking \
on my own bile\
spews out, acid \
scalding the walls\
just like-

Up wind, the mighty took breakfast in silence. "Manageable" was the word we used to mean "slipping it slowly away" and then "I'm wondering where we'll be after everything-this-is in the lobby." Once someone imagined the buttress, there wasn't no going back as much as there wasn't no twirling in place anymore. Juniper and June didn't talk so much with their mittens after that. One by one, I made criteria for better friendships. Ending a poem in the wrong place as a way to save paper. Mazeless and afraid, she surrendered to the future and its big white rooms. Michael, whose being-friends-with-me was friends with mine. "It wasn't personal about Thursday," he forgot in scared-witless quotations "it's just I love you in the way that kills white-tailed deer." I wanted to be an inventor for the past imperative forms, like a "stop" for twenty years ago. Mastery in one discipline did not, in general, lead to mastery in others. Going on not much, which is often a mid-range amount, you made up a way I was feeling about Sandy. Previously and how much the winter wanted spring. Again the annual convention of Captains Planet. I had a computer and it wanted me more or less in my squishy particulars. So surprise yourself with the pleasure in imagining an egg.

In the major keys, blessings are abundant which makes us happy which makes us hateful. Adverbs don't do well on their own. Doors that go in are never as interesting as doors that go up. The Latinate prefix "con-" can denote togetherness and it can denote intensification and so she made the constellation brighter with the full might of her psychic powers. Green flies are used to winds that can blow them away. Their mission statements have included "Bring out your best you forever" and "Mildred I'll never stop calling". Yours, truly.

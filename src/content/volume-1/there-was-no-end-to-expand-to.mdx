<ThereWasImage />

From these edges torn a fibrous fissure froms and froths.

Edges fraught with peripheral degeneration, a fringy pith skirting the threshold. 

Will the violet fog scatter a spectral withness. 

Will obsidian smoke fill the fractures. 

Will the hovering monochrome suture feral scraps into a horizon.

To fabricate intimacy at elsewhere’s edge, the periphery assembles a medial expanse, a vertical pupil beholding beyond.

A field grows within a field, effecting a contrapuntal fringe and verge. 

Threshold ridden with fog and smoke.

Expanse fraught with forest obscure.

Boundary opaque with to and from.

The forest is turned on its head.

The field is feral with severance.

The periphery is ill with boundary.

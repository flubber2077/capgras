I felt a spark between us\
But it was very dry\
And so immediately doused it\
By the sprinkler that makes grass\
Green in the desert elevation\
The wily contestant who rubs sticks\
Clockwise, then counterclockwise\
Then laughs bitterly\
And cocks her head at the sun\
Its variable spot\
Which can be removed like X\
To deign a distinct value\
On one side of the equation\
Like a freckle on the face\
Please like me\
It chirps, having submerged its foot in mud\
Ever the elder daughter\
A rarity these days, still water\
That serves no purpose\
Then squelches it out\
Irritating the racecar driver\
Whose neck has begun to hurt\
Even after all that resistance training\
Tugging on his skull\
With a band that measures its weight\
And being drunk on champagne\
A week later, in Amsterdam\

He broke his nose\
In the grooves\
Of sky across Heavenly\
Valley. But I am unqualified\
Not a teacher in Bavaria\
And so do not hold\
The magic trick a
Young prodigy (such as yourself)\
Related in the garden\
Prompted by her future aunt\
In one of the several preludes\
To Sofia’s Big Day\
But I don’t remember it\
After a long day\
I would like to be fashionable\
Winged eyeliner by the fact\
That I ate a good meal\
Alongside my fictive brothers\
Who propagate around the table\
At the Gallery\
A very legendary\
Eating spot. Soft chairs, stay as long as you like

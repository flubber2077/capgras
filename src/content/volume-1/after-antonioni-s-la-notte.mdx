 The champagne comes

and white stairways fly, jet-black

strawberries and white

stairways fly from

hospital silver. Release the trays

of gold

\*

Truffles to the animals—they

claw our suits, mal-

aise ma-

laise m-

a-l-a-i-s-e

\*

Into whose marble arms are we

released and what grey veins?

Each rocket is a cairn

of fibrous smoke.

Find your way home.

Find your way back

to me,

\*

I know

you’ll settle here.

Here, worm touches sky.

Here, glass façades are robust,

fibrous water

\*

Stop beside the tracks

for coffee-colored rust—the rust

is everywhere beneath the light.

The boys with the rockets.

They’re gone now.

They’re gone now.

They

are

gone

now

\*

How pretty the pool is

with its blue garlands

on white garlands

with its frayed crowns

with its beetles and leaves

\*

How pretty the pool is

with its teething garlands of blue

and its trim-torsoed, long-limbed light

\*

When the statues wake,

I cut their cheeks, Ozymandias

\*

When the statues wake,

the light and skin align;

briskly the flesh chatters

\*

Valentina, seven-pointed star,

is that black blood pooling

in your mouth? Have the lines

around the buzzards’ eyes

turned silver? What shall

we play for? When you

\*

Were sick, I

came to you; I tended you; I

loved you; I loved you

despite yourself; I helped you

remember your name

\*

These mansions push

a horn in my chest. Let

me savor that debt let me

savor that debt let me savor

that debt

\*

Say the strands are bright.

Under long lamps, all-flesh in bright strands.

On slick roads, strands from the lamps,

wet hair and shining laughter.

Take me to hereafters

of chains and milk, refusals.

It’s like the sadness of a dog

\*

Will the syrinx split the head in two?

The lie’s trunk rears between its

two giant ears. We are reduced

and from nothing or not nothing

or from one another and without

restraint or brought to nothing

or very nearly ruin and disaster

disaster dis-aster then not

then take things as they come

Questions rebound through lonesome windows\
like failures through a memory\
or the creaks across the floorboards\
too paranoid to fasten quiet

I live in a mill\
with my termites\
They draw each other nearer\
colder inside one padlocked gaze\
slightly veined and dull with hindsight\
Blue clouds approach from their exhalations\
spreading at an opiated pace\
and questions float between them\
like illegible omens do\
from star to star to star to star

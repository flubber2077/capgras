*after Bug (2006)*

Questions rebound through lonesome windows

like failures through a memory

or the creaks across the floorboards

too paranoid to fasten quiet

I live in a mill

with my termites

They draw each other nearer

colder inside one padlocked gaze

slightly veined and dull with hindsight

Blue clouds approach from their exhalations

spreading at an opiated pace

and questions float between them

like illegible omens do

from star to star to star to star

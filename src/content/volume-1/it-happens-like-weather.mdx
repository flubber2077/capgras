The enormous gathering up\
of all my time into what mirror\
it starts as your keen sprained eyes\
behind black plastic paranoia\
or breathwork in the stadium elevator\
then never to find a car ride home\
The ash trees held the light for us\
and stories handcuffed to telephones\
and sliding alphabets into gray blue\
photos of radios clouds your hair\
Nothing happening but to drift as\
holograph the way spirals evenings\
the cafeteria they filled with music\
as all I wanted was to write you\
without name without a face or past\
a landscape colliding now lost Ohio\
the torus shifts mechanical & violet\
When you begin in me by trespass by\
missed occasion sketches thumbtacked\
a word demolished in air conditioning\
Welcome style of Late Montage Hotel\
if love as a coincidence impossible now\
in warehoused images become rustic\
as disappearing to begin this over in you\
my subscription annulled in fascia so\
by morning I know nothing by evening\
nothing changed thoroughly addressing\
all of this all over itself a myriad inviting\
actuals you can really see happening!\
(the air conditioning demolished spy)\
Comes word one hundred ninety-five\
and say creation of gentleness in chaos\
will ask only for other fission no portrait\
or personal memento kitsch of eras to\
\
behold no John Ashbery T shirt logo\
I’d feel a perfect dizziness noise library\
of Buddhist monks spilling the cosmos’\
chalkdust into the river & Keats too\
as a docent sings last century’s stereo\
saying That last piece is a keeper.

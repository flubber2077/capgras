The champagne comes\
and white stairways fly, jet-black\
strawberries and white\
stairways fly from\
hospital silver. Release the trays\
of gold

\*\
Truffles to the animals—they\
claw our suits, mal-\
aise ma-\
laise m-\
a-l-a-i-s-e

\*\
Into whose marble arms are we\
released and what grey veins?\
Each rocket is a cairn\
of fibrous smoke.\
Find your way home.\
Find your way back\
to me,

\*\
I know\
you’ll settle here.\
Here, worm touches sky.\
Here, glass façades are robust,\
fibrous water

\*\
Stop beside the tracks\
for coffee-colored rust—the rust\
is everywhere beneath the light.\
The boys with the rockets.\
They’re gone now.\
They’re gone now.\
They\
are\
gone\
now

\*\
How pretty the pool is\
with its blue garlands\
on white garlands\
with its frayed crowns\
with its beetles and leaves

\*\
How pretty the pool is\
with its teething garlands of blue\
and its trim-torsoed, long-limbed light

\*\
When the statues wake,\
I cut their cheeks, Ozymandias

\*\
When the statues wake,\
the light and skin align;\
briskly the flesh chatters

\*\
Valentina, seven-pointed star,\
is that black blood pooling\
in your mouth? Have the lines\
around the buzzards’ eyes\
turned silver? What shall\
we play for? When you

\*\
Were sick, I\
came to you; I tended you; I\
loved you; I loved you\
despite yourself; I helped you\
remember your name

\*\
These mansions push\
a horn in my chest. Let\
me savor that debt let me\
savor that debt let me savor\
that debt

\*\
Say the strands are bright.\
Under long lamps, all-flesh in bright strands.\
On slick roads, strands from the lamps,\
wet hair and shining laughter.\
Take me to hereafters\
of chains and milk, refusals.\
It’s like the sadness of a dog

\*\
Will the syrinx split the head in two?\
The lie’s trunk rears between its\
two giant ears. We are reduced\
and from nothing or not nothing\
or from one another and without\
restraint or brought to nothing\
or very nearly ruin and disaster\
disaster dis-aster then not\
then take things as they come

from _Scarecrow_ \[Wesleyan University Press, 2016\]

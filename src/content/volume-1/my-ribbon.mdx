becomes your ribbon\
is your child. I am more\
like the wall. My lifemark,\
I wear your talented ink.

Hammered by jack,\
the vertigo sets in.

My fullest slope\
lies with Jill, I\
flash primary.

First meeting is\
last. The opposable,\
is green â€”both\
hands so ruby.

My body as\
scrimmage,\
a coloring book.

I zip my denim past\
my forehead

but the serial rings\
sharp. Nerves knew\
before walnut.

A premonition of\
your scary score,\
my friable system.

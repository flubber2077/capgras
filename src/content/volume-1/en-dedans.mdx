Hello jest, hello sultry\
Mid-eve, hello toy\
Veil on display : Offer\
To be offered. I beg you

Don’t bother this blush\
-Breasted finch at paralysis\
On my faintly pounding\
Wrist. It will swell

Paranoid. Motion to mauve\
My chamber doors. Call me hardly\
Merely. Call me an intelligent\
Pile of yarn that yelps

At your touch, constricts\
Immediate. Fasten me ankle\
-Wise. Descend us\
Into your waltzing

Traipse. O Honeyed— Spangled\
—O Delude! And then —\
Temper. My throat fat with\
Hum heartbeats this cotton

Collar, threatens it agape,\
Your finch to rustle in

# Notes

## design details

color header should be black
poem background should be page colored and maybe textured
small flourish on each page

navbar should glide
maybe use cormorant instead of cormorant garamond
display vs body font, cormorant is a display, cormorant garamond is built more for body, but eb garamond is explicitly body

Fix iphone top bar display

capgras landing page should say "a poetry magazine" or something. if someone lands on the page the page should say _something_ about what it is

## tech details

can i delete the other fonts
need to make favicons
change text font to EB garamond and test

update back to nextjs 15

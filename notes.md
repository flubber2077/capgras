color header should be black

landing image needs to size better, probably needs to be scaled down initially

`hr` bar should probably have color

<!-- navbar should glide -->
<!-- capgras landing page should say "a poetry magazine" or something. if someone lands on the page the page should say _something_ about what it is -->

## notes from ellen and i testing

switching between volumes and about on chrome/windows changes header (this is something about how chrome is reading the font, i dont think i can fix)

safari svg animation not starting until interaction (it's actually on load. I put a hotfix on, it didn't fix the issue but the rendering mode supposedly has less overall bugs)

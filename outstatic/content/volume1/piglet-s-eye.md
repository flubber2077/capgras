I saw it go down, the goose dawn.\
I wasn’t supposed to. See it all spread\
on the lawn. I touch you on your soaking piglet’s eye.\
I have been trying to sync. I press playfully. Is it good?\
Ages ago I grew tender prongs from my salivary glands. Sincerely,\
I was agog. I’ve been shaving my shadow down\
since. The separation between ground and I\
is now nearly gone in the sun’s guzzle.\
In the spirit of disclosure, I saw you\
swaddled in goose down. I was with you,\
I saw you foam loud,\
combing moans inches from sound.

- upload second volume
- fix eslint issues
- see if react compiler can be used on this project. I'm guessing no as almost everything should be SSR
- Redirect old volume-1/ links to volumes/1/

later
- Try to get bottom logo working on chrome and safari
- page where all of a volumes poems are on the same page
- Top and bottom logo move in and out together

much later

- Get custom interactive audio working
